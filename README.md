# simple-scraper for demonstrating purposes only

If running on Linux or MAC OS, call the script like this:

`python simple-scraper.py`

or if you want additional settings, do this:

`python simple-scraper.py --workers 12 --max 25 --sort likes --csv > data.csv`

this will tell the script to use 12 pool workers (run the script asincrouniously), show the top 25 results sorted by likes and export the data in csv file named data.csv


Sample result from the above command:
